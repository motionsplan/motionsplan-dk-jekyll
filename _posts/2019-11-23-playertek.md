Playr fra Playertek er en GPS-tracker, aktivitetstracker og accelerometer, som kan bruges til at _tracke_ fodbold og andre idrætsgrene.

{% include feature_row type="left" %}

Playr virker bedst udendørs, hvor den kan få kontakt til GPS-satelitterne. Playr knyttes an til en _smartphone_, hvor du kan måle og følge din træning.

https://medium.com/playertek/frequently-asked-questions-9483b3540ae7


## Distance

## Sprint distance

## Power plays

## Player load

## HR load

Weighted average of the time spent in different zones. Playertek+ uses only 4 trimp zones for HR load as follows.

Time in zone 4 and 5.


## Questions

How is PlayerLoad measured?

PlayerLoad is a measure of instantaneous rate of change of acceleration divided by a scaling factor, which reduces the value of the accumulated PlayerLoad to about 1000 to make the number much easier to work with. PlayerLoad was originally developed at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and is used by over 1000 elite teams worldwide.

What is a Session Score?

Your session score is an indication of how much you have done compared to a game based on your game values and targets. So a session score of 65 for a practice session would indicate that the session load was equal to 65% of a full game load.

What is a Power Play?

Power Plays are a count of explosive movements such as sprints. A power play is logged every time a player generates over 20w/kg of power in their activity.

What does Power Score mean and how is it used to identify player performance?

The power score is an average power output for a player during a game or training session based on both the speed levels reached and the acceleration rates achieved throughout the session.
What do the number of impacts tell me as a coach?

Impacts will tell you how many collisions the player has taken over 5g (customizable in player profile). This can be used to determine a possible trend that lead to an injury or as an exertion tool to help understand the load on athletes.
