Vanderburgh og Laubach har lavet en formel, så du kan sammenligne løbetider på tværs af alder og vægt.

Vanderburgh og Laubach kalder det for _Flyer Handicap_. Formlen går ud fra, at alle er 25 år gamle. Kvinderne vejer 110lbs og mændene vejer 143lbs. Derved kan du sammenligne dine tider med andre, som har forskellige alder og vægt.

## Hvad er Flyer Handicap?



What is the Flyer Handicap?
The Flyer Handicap is your 5K, 10K, 1/2 Marathon or Marathon race time adjusted by age and body weight. This adjusted run time is a precise computation of what your equivalent time would be if you were younger and lighter, specifically 25 years old and 110 lbs for women and 143 lbs for men. Your resulting score can then be compared to that of any other adult runner of different age. If you are younger or lighter than these figures, then for the purposes of computing your adjusted time, the baseline figures are entered for your age and/or body weight. Dr. Paul M. Vanderburgh and Dr. Lloyd L. Laubach developed it at the University of Dayton, Dayton, OH.

Weight-Age-Graded Time
*We do not assume you start losing the ability to set pr's after the age of 25. Dont take it too personally! There is a lot of science behind it so thank Paul Vanderburgh for creating this for the running community!

What is my Weight-Age-Graded Time?
It is a statistical calculation of your "adjusted" run time (5K, 10K, 1/2 Marathon or Marathon) if you were 25 yrs old and either 110 lbs (F) or 143 lbs (M) based on your actual age, weight and run time.  In this calculation, the Flyer Handicap assumes that not only are you lighter but you are also a "scale model" of yourself and are, therefore, shorter.   

What is the science behind this Flyer Handicap? 
The handicap is based on the documented decline in aerobic function, specifically distance run speed, due to increasing age and fat-free mass.  Download the attached PowerPoint presentation for more information.  We also have two research papers on the Flyer Handicap.  The first, which explains the derivation, is in the March 2007 issue of Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science.  Click here for a pdf copy.  The second, a validation study, is in the December 2006 edition of the Journal of Exercise Physiology (online).  Click here for a pdf copy.  

Note:  If you enter age below 25 the Flyer Handicap will use 25 as your age.  If you enter weight below 110 lbs or 143 lbs for women and men, respectively, the Flyer Handicap will use 110 lbs if you are a woman and 143 lbs if you are a man.  Lower ages and weights than these are, for most runners, generally not an advantage.
