Her har du en guide til at cykle på hometrainer med RGT Cyling. Det er en virtuel cykelplatform, som kan gøre indendørs træningen lidt mere interessant.

RGT Cykling er et alternativ til det meget populære Zwift. Fordelen ved RGT Cykling er, at du kan komme i gang gratis og køre nogle enkelte ruter uden at skulle betale. Samtidig kan du også gratis deltage i events på platformen. Bl.a. derfor køres DM også på RGT i 2022.

## Om RGT Cycling

RGT Cycling er en relativt ny platform inden for træning på hometrainer. Det er gratis at deltage i cykelløb på platformen. Du skal altså ikke betale et abonnement for at køre på platformen.

RGT Cycling har lige nu også et lille forspring på en mere realistisk dynamik i løbene. På RGT Cycling kan du blive lukket inde i en sprint, hvis du sidder forkert. Du kan heller ikke træde rundt i skarpe sving, hvor farten altså bliver lidt lavere.

I 2022 køres flere af de nationale forbund deres mesterskaber på RGT Cycling, og USA benytter fx platformen til at udtage deres landshold, som i 2022 køres på Zwift.

## Gratis klublogin

Cycling Danmark har lavet et samarbejde med RGT Cycling. Det beyder, at cykelklubber kan få et [gratis adgang til platformen](https://www.cyklingdanmark.dk/klubmedlems-nyheder/vis-nyhed/article/gratis-klublogin-til-rgt-cycling/). Det betyder, at klubberne gratis kan arrangere både cykelløb, cykelruter og træninger på platformen.

## Fordele ved RGT Cykling

RGT Cykling fungerer rigtig godt. Du behøver kun en app til at styre platformen. Jeg synes grafikken i appen er lidt bedre end Zwift, og det er lidt lettere at have overblik over ruten, mens du kører.

Desuden tæller det altid i min bog, at platformen er gratis. Udvalget af ruter på den gratis udgave og træninger er meget begrænset, men du kan gratis deltage i alle de enkelte løb og events.

## Ulemper ved RGT

Jeg synes ikke, at der er så mange ulemper ved RGT Cykling. Hvis du gerne vil køre på en social platform med flere brugere, så er Zwift formentlig bedre, men jeg tror RGT Cykling kommer efter det ganske snart.

Hvis du gerne vil have en mere livagtig grafik, så er [Rouvy](/rouvy/) eller [BKOOL](/bkool-begynderguide/) formentlig bedre alternativer, da de tager udgangspunkt i realistiske optagelser.

RGT Cykling kan heller ikke connecte til så mange eksterne services som Zwift. Det er dog ikke noget problem for mig, da jeg optager alle mine træninger på Garmin Connect, så jeg har alle træningsdata samlet der. Så synkroniserer jeg mine Zwift og RGT træninger op til Strava og sletter de træningspas på Strava, der bliver synkroniseret fra Garmin.

På Strava kan jeg således dele alle mine træninger og løb på en fornuftig måde, men jeg bruger Garmin Connect til at analysere min træning.

Zwift har et større netværk, og de har Companion app'en, som rigtig mange mennesker synes er rigtig smart til at få overblik over fællesskabet og events. Samtidig er der Zwiftpower, som giver et godt overblik over dine data fra de løb, du har deltaget i.

4 alternatives to Zwift: advantages and disadvantages
TRAINING 22 ABR. 2020 01:04 MIGUE A.

Facebook Twitter Email
If you're looking for a virtual cycling platform, you've heard of Zwift. Without a doubt, it is the great beneficiary of this sudden and forced boom of virtual cycling. But Zwift is not alone in this new world. Here you can find 4 other options as interesting as Zwift itself.

alternativas-zwift/

4 alternatives to Zwift
BKOOL
The first option is Bkool. It is quite well known, especially since it has also been a manufacturer of turbo trainers.The brand recently decided to leave manufacturing aside and focus on its cycling simulator. It is a clear competition to Zwift, but it has some disadvantages that they will surely be trying to save in order to boost the software.

First of all, if you have a Bkool turbo trainer, everything will be much easier for you. For connectivity, features and sensations. They are very good for a realistic experience within the program, they even simulate slopes and their ease of assembly and disassembly is evident. Besides, they have a great design.

A Bkool turbo trainer can also be used with Zwift, but in its native application it is more complete. The main details of this alternative to Zwift are as follows.

 

alternativas-zwift/

First of all, the price. The free version is very limited in Bkool, with no features or even a 3D view. That's why, if you have invested in a quality turbo trainer, it will cost you very little to register for its premium version. And it must be said that the Premium version is very worthwhile. It costs 9.99 euros per month, but if you sign up for a full year, the monthly price drops to 8 euros. For that price you have the possibility of running in all the circuits, alternating the views (simulator view, first person view with real images, and map view of the route). The realistic first-person view is built with real images. Therefore, it has many absolutely real routes, that's a plus.

You can ride either in stages or solo on these courses. But the social aspect is limited. Rather than going out in a group, it will be a choice between going alone or taking advantage of everything you find.
On the other hand, it must be said that the graphics need slight improvements, it becomes monotonous sometimes.

ROUVY
Rouvy calls itself the world's leading virtual cycling platform. It is true that it has been working in this field for a long time, but we do not know the number of users to make a comparison with Zwift.

It has important differences with the rest. The strength and focus of Rouvy is augmented reality. It is based on recording real images of the route, and then virtually overlaying you when you are pedaling on the platform.

 

alternativas-zwift/

This platform does allow meetings -as in Zwift- with your colleagues or friends. Its price is the same as in Bkool: 10 euros per month. If you want to check Rouvy, you have 2 weeks for free to do so.

We insist: as an alternative to Zwift for pedaling on totally real roads, it is a very interesting option. In fact, you often go out riding just to see the scenery and get away with it. In that case, Rouvy is perhaps the best option within the range of cycling simulators. If you're into triathlon, go for this one, because as an official Ironman sponsor, Rouvy makes the courses available and is very active during triathlon events.

RGT CYCLING
Their free version is perhaps the most complete of all these options. You will also ride on realistic tracks and circuits, with images of 8 mythical stages that you can use as many times as you want at no extra cost. Best of all: they announced that during the quarantine, the complete simulator is free. It's a good time to try it out.

We have to insist that the free version is complete, very complete compared to the competition. However, the paid version is more expensive than the rest: 14.99 euros per month for a platform that, although as we say, is very good in terms of realism, still suffers from a lack of profiles. Its price is 50% more expensive than the previous options or Zwift. In addition, it requires a device (computer, smartphone or tablet) with enough power to support its image.

alternativas-zwift/

For these two reasons we qualify it as a higher-ranking option. It is certainly a different strategy, aimed at a different audience. It's RGT Cycling's bet. There are group events too, as well as competitions. If you are looking for something similar to Zwift, maybe RGT Cycling is the most similar.

THE SUFFERFEST
Each application has its own header brands. The Sufferfest was acquired by Wahoo two years ago and its goal was clear: no cycling social network, but a very complete training platform.

Today it is much more than that, but it still maintains its identity as a cycling training platform, something that is far from Zwift but also from the rest of the virtual cycling software.

You can even use it without a smart turbo trainer or sensor. In other words, while any of the applications we propose can be used with a normal turbo trainer by placing speed and cadence sensors at least, The Sufferfest allows you to roll and let you adapt your turbo trainer to the conditions.

alternativas-zwift/

Think about this platform if your goal is just to train hard, away from all social interaction and simulation. Its 4DP system will tell you what your cycling profile is and will propose your training plan, a training that becomes immersive. That is to say, with real images while you ride, that is their type of simulation. Its price, $14.99 per month, although with the annual plan you can use it for 129 and save 50. You can try the free version for 2 weeks.

The rise of Zwift during the coronavirus crisis
Zwift's success has been growing and exploding in this Covid-19 pandemic. Many cyclists were prepared, and right now Zwift is their evasion at home. For most, this has caught them off guard and they are desperately looking for ways to enter this universe of virtual cycling.

So these are the four options you have besides Zwift. Here are the facts, now the decision is yours.

5 best zwift alternative apps in 2021 - tried and tested by a pro rider! 
Indoor cycling apps that are not Zwift: an introduction
Zwift is probably the world's biggest indoor cycling software at this moment in time, having the largest number of users. But that doesn't mean there aren't any Zwift alternatives - there have long been various options for training indoors and defeating the boredom of a blank wall staring back at you as you monotonously pound your pedals while the weather outside is inclement. For example, I used to watch hours of recordings that I had made of the Tour de France and Spring classics. I know others who have committed to a Netflix series exclusively for the turbo, to combat the encroaching madness.

Zwift, for me, has been an ample replacement to these decent (but far from ideal) indoor cycling stimuli. With the array of options and the community that has built up around the software, I find myself feeling very much part of a global family. That said, Zwift is not for everyone and not everyone falls in love with the game as I have done. The great thing is that there are many, many alternatives! A smart trainer can communicate simply and easily with many apps, all designed to enhance your indoor cycling experience. Most (if not all) smart trainers come with a free trial of at least one app, but more commonly they feature multiple different training and cycling apps. These range from simple structured training plans and workouts to full virtual cycling worlds. So, if you're unsure about getting into indoor training using a smart trainer, or unsure if Zwift is for you, read on to discover the plethora of other virtual worlds, augmented realities and training apps that could enhance your indoor training. 

Smart trainer - jargon buster 
Just like smart phones, smart trainers can be loaded with a variety of different apps, depending on the make and model you choose. Most, if not all, the apps mentioned in this article will work with smart trainers that are ANT+ or Bluetooth compatible - this is the standard communication used between apps and the smart trainer and is, in essence, what makes your trainer “smart”. Be aware, though, that some trainers that are ANT+ and Bluetooth compatible don’t have the variable resistance function, so you will be able to connect to the apps but your trainer will not adjust the resistance.

You can use simple turbo trainers with most apps too, if you are not willing to fork out the extra money for a smart trainer. A standard old-school turbo that doesn’t require plugging in can work well with most apps in two ways. First, you could use a bike based power meter (crank or pedal or rear wheel) to provide the power reading to the apps. This works with the same connection as a smart turbo (either ANT+ or Bluetooth), and while it gives you a slightly less immersive experience it still enables you to utilise the benefits of the virtual world riding experiences without the extra cost of a smart trainer. Alternatively, Zwift can be run using a cadence sensor connected to the game (there is an algorithm that calculates your power using the speed of your bicycle wheel and pedalling cadence). This may also exist in other apps, but apps that work on power readings will definitely require a power meter (either crank based or smart turbo). It's important to note that some apps may require you to have a smart trainer, and cannot be used with traditional turbos. I know Zwift will work with both standard and smart trainers.

It's also a good idea to use a Heart Rate (HR) monitor in tandem with your trainer, as it will give you extra information on your training and some platforms (like Zwift, for example) have competitive events that actually require you to use a HR monitor to verify your performances. You may also want to use a Smart TV or Apple TV. With an Apple TV you can run most cycling apps straight from the TV and connect via Bluetooth to your turbo trainer. If you are using a normal TV or smart TV you may also be able to do this, or you could link your computer that is running your training device to the TV via an HDMI cable. The benefits of having your cycling app up on a big screen are huge, both for your eyes and enjoyment of using the software - the bigger the screen, the better, because it gives you a more immersive, real-life experience as opposed to squinting at a small phone or tablet. From personal experience, Apple TV can be a little temperamental but I’ve found that a high quality HDMI cable from a reasonably high-spec laptop works brilliantly on a big screen!

So, you have your turbo set up, either a smart one or a traditional one augmented with power meters or cadence sensors, and you might even have your big screen up and ready to immerse you into a world of virtual cycling - but NOT Watopia! Without further ado, here are the top picks of indoor cycling apps that are the best alternative to Zwift, as tested by me and my pro-cycling compadres!  

RGT Cycling (Road Grand Tours) 
RGT Cycling are very much the new kids on the block. The platform is fast growing and even beginning to rival Zwift. I know many riders that have altered from being Zwifters to “RGT-ers”. The attraction of RGT is its real world symmetry - unlike Zwift, whose biggest attraction is probably the massive fictitious world of Watopia, all of RGTs routes and roads are based upon real roadways and routes from around the world.

RGT has a few options for virtual cycling: first of all, there are Real Roads. These are actual routes in real life, replicated with ultra-high detail. The list of these is currently quite small, but growing all the time, and today includes Mont Ventoux, the Paterberg, Pienza, the Stelvio and more. Secondly, RGT Cycling also has a range of different events - more event types than even Zwift. There is a normal race, time trials, an elimination style race, group rides and group training rides. More than enough to rival the Zwift experience! The structured training offered by RGT is also very similar to that of Zwift; RGT Cycling has worked with some of the world’s best coaches to provide sessions and training plans to help improve any athlete.

The really great feature of RGT Cycling is its Magic Roads feature - this is a step to revolutionise virtual riding. With Magic Roads you are not constrained by any pre-programmed routes or virtual worlds like Watopia, you choose the route you ride. Is it a real world road? Then you can create it in Magic Roads. The graphics are still perhaps a little behind those of the Real Roads, however all the elevation and inclines are correct to a tee. As soon as RGT Cycling can incorporate some form of features in a chosen Magic Road route to match those of the real world it will undoubtedly become the world’s biggest virtual riding software. My suggestion is to somehow extrapolate the data from maps to convert into like-for-like scenery - this will be the key to the Magic Roads being more realistic. At the moment, many users state the Magic Roads often feel a bit like being on a treadmill with the same scenery rolling past eternally.

To access RGT Cycling Magic Roads, to be able to organise events, and to connect your training plans to the software you need to be a premium member. This is however significantly less expensive than Zwift at only £6.99 per month. RGT also has a free subscription, where you have access to a limited number of the software’s features, but it still enables you to really find out if it is for you or not. If you decide you don’t need the full shebang, just stick with the free subscription and enjoy the real world virtual cycling!

Trainer Road 
This is indoor cycling software for Mac, PC, and iOS. It works by picking up the data from your Bluetooth Smart or ANT+ wireless devices, and gives athletes structured, power-based interval workouts. Trainer Road is like a dedicated indoor version of Training Peaks, where you can track your training and workouts in high detail. In terms of virtual reality, Trainer Road doesn’t offer any virtual world riding experience. Its main focus is cycling training, in the form of interval training to power. The workouts and training will work around your FTP and build your training zones from there to focused interval sessions. Interval training is proven to be the most effective way to improve performance, so Trainer Road could be a fast track way to achieve your desired cycling ability in double-quick time. The absence of augmented reality is no real loss as the software gives you detailed feedback on your session and intervals you have completed. For those of you seeking high quality interval sessions designed by world class coaches, Trainer Road is for you. A great training technology, with AI and machine learning from each of your sessions, it gives you self-sufficiency in following a training plan and understanding your own progress.

Sufferfest 
Put simply, this is horrendously hard. It’s called Sufferfest for a reason. Having done a number of Sufferfest sessions, I can also say it is probably the most exciting way to do indoor interval training! The training videos will guide you through your efforts, with sound effects and corresponding video footage of pro races and various riding to inspire you to bludgeon those pedals. These high quality training videos are combined with additional yoga and strength resources to make you into a complete athlete. All your data is stored in your passport so you can analyse it in detail. With a 14 day free trial, it is definitely worth a test if you’re looking for those high quality intervals with a bit of spice and excitement as well as a full off bike routine too. Intervals in Zwift and RGT can often just feel the same as intervals out on the road; with Sufferfest you feel like you’re taking part in something more bonkers! The app also utilises what is known as 'four dimensional power' to build your workouts. This is to give you a full power profile rather than simply using FTP. Sufferfest believe this enables them to give you a better, more precise form of training session which takes into account you as an athlete, rather than using a generic FTP formula for sessions. It makes sense when you think about it; every athlete is different! 

The strength training videos that the platform offers are a great tool. The best athletes and the best cyclists are not just made on the bike, but in the gym too! It's a very good way to give your intervals that X-factor to make you go harder. I love Sufferfest for high intensity workouts that are soul destroying without any kind of stimulus.
