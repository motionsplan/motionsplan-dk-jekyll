Du kan finde dit kondital i roning og måle din kondition med en maksimal konditiontest på romaskine. Det er en 2000 meter maksimal test på et roergometer.

Jeg har fundet to forskellige forslag til, hvordan du kan udregne konditallet ud fra 2000-meter testen på roergomenter.

## Udregning af kondital brugt af Concept2 ud fra tiden

Hos [Concept2](https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/calculators/vo2max-calculator) bruger de data fra Fritz Hagerman.

Fritz Hagerman fra Ohio University har lavet formlerne bag testen gennem mange år. Hagerman har udført VO<sub>2</sub>max tests med maske og de samme forsøgspersoner har også lavet en maksimal 2000 meter test på romaskine. Derefter har Hagerman lavet en korrelation mellem de to tests, som benyttes i nedenstående beregner af kondital på baggrund af en test i romaskine.

## Beregn din kondition og kondital fra maksimal test på romaskine?

## Test i roning ud fra _mean power output_

[Klusiewicz og Faff (2003)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47619695_Indirect_methods_of_estimating_maximal_oxygen_uptake_on_the_rowing_ergometer) har lavet andre formler til at teste den maksimale iltoptagelse ud fra 2000-metertesten.

> The most accurate predicted values of VO2max were obtained based on the linear regression of VO2max against the mean power output (WM) in the 2-km test using the following formulas: VO2max (l•min-1) in the males = 1.682+0.0097 WM; VO2max (l•min-1) in the females = 1.631+0.0088 WM.

[Klusiewicz og Faff (2003)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47619695_Indirect_methods_of_estimating_maximal_oxygen_uptake_on_the_rowing_ergometer) bruger altså _mean power output_ på 2-kilometer testen i roning til at estimere den maksimale iltoptagelse.

## Hvad er dine oplevelser med tests til roning?

Jeg er i gang med at teste formlerne op mod hinanden. I den forbindelse er jeg meget interesseret i at kende jeres erfaringer med tests på roergometere?

## Hvad er en god 2000-meter tid på roergometer?

Du kan finde de danske rekorder for roning på roergometer på [ergometertider.dk](https://ergometertider.dk/). Concept2 har også lavet en liste over [verdensrekorder sat på Concept2-roergometer på 2000-meter distancen](https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/racing/records/world/2000).

VO2max stands for maximal oxygen uptake and refers to the amount of oxygen your body is capable of utilizing in one minute. It is a measure of your capacity for aerobic work and can be a predictor of your potential as an endurance athlete. Although there are many factors that affect your VO2max, it is a commonly accepted measure of cardio respiratory fitness.

Before Using this Calculator
Please understand the following:

This calculator provides an estimate only. For a more accurate calculation, VO2max is best measured in a lab.
This calculator is based on a collection of real data points. Even if the estimates seem unlikely, they are based on real people and the range of variability that exists.
You may see some confusing numbers if you do calculations for both training levels and your weight is right at the point where the formula changes. Again, this formula was derived from a collection of real data points and variabilities. See the FAQs for the formula used.
If you have questions about your calculation or how this calculator was created, please consult our FAQs. Although we generally welcome your emails, we have tried to include all pertinent information in the FAQs and don't have much else to offer beyond what is presented on this page.

Frequently Asked Questions
How was this tool created?

This tool is based on thousands of real data points collected by Dr. Fritz Hagerman of Ohio University. Over the years, Dr. Hagerman performed VO2max tests using gas analysis on many subjects. He also had the same subjects row a max 2000m test piece on the indoor rower. He then correlated the two tests to create the formulae used in this prediction tool.

What should I make of the number I get?
What factors affect VO2max?
What are some other examples of training level?

If you have been rowing regularly for several years, training at least four days per week, doing a variety of workout types and improving your rowing scores, then we suggest selecting "Highly trained" when using the calculator.
If you consider yourself a fitness rower and don't push yourself very hard or do any hard pieces, then we suggest selecting "Not highly trained."

What is the formula used?
How much can I improve my VO2max?
What damper setting should I use for my 2000m test piece?
How should I adjust the VO2 max calculator for altitude?
Why are older age groups not included?

V02 = (Y * 1000) / Weight

Y is determined as follows:

 	Female	Male
Weight <= 61.36kg	Weight > 61.36kg	Weight <= 75kg	Weight > 75kg
Training Level: HIGH	Y = 14.6 - (1.5 * Time)	Y = 14.9 - (1.5 * Time)	Y = 15.1 - (1.5 * Time)	Y = 15.7 - (1.5 * Time)
Training Level: LOW	Y = 10.26 - (0.93 * Time)	Y = 10.7 - (0.9 * Time)
 	Time is the pace converted to minutes.
