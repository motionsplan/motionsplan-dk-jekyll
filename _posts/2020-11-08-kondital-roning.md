Du kan finde dit kondital og måle din kondition med en maksimal konditiontest på romaskine. Det er en 2000 meter maksimal test på romaskine.

Fritz Hagerman fra Ohio University har lavet formlerne bag testen gennem mange år. Hagerman har udført VO<sub>2</sub>max tests med maske og de samme forsøgspersoner har også lavet en maksimal 2000 meter test på romaskine. Derefter har Hagerman lavet en korrelation mellem de to tests, som benyttes i nedenstående beregner af kondital på baggrund af en test i romaskine.

## Beregn din kondition og kondital fra maksimal test på romaskine?

VO2max stands for maximal oxygen uptake and refers to the amount of oxygen your body is capable of utilizing in one minute. It is a measure of your capacity for aerobic work and can be a predictor of your potential as an endurance athlete. Although there are many factors that affect your VO2max, it is a commonly accepted measure of cardio respiratory fitness.

Before Using this Calculator
Please understand the following:

This calculator provides an estimate only. For a more accurate calculation, VO2max is best measured in a lab.
This calculator is based on a collection of real data points. Even if the estimates seem unlikely, they are based on real people and the range of variability that exists.
You may see some confusing numbers if you do calculations for both training levels and your weight is right at the point where the formula changes. Again, this formula was derived from a collection of real data points and variabilities. See the FAQs for the formula used.
If you have questions about your calculation or how this calculator was created, please consult our FAQs. Although we generally welcome your emails, we have tried to include all pertinent information in the FAQs and don't have much else to offer beyond what is presented on this page.
Cardiovascular Fitness Calculations

Based on VO2max (mL*kg-1*min-1)

Gender	Age	Poor	Fair	Average	Good	Excellent
Men	< 29	< 24.9	25-33.9	34-43.9	44-52.9	> 53
 	30-39	< 22.9	23-30.9	31-41.9	42-49.9	> 50
 	40-49	< 19.9	20-26.9	27-38.9	39-44.9	> 45
 	50-59	< 17.9	18-24.9	25-37.9	38-42.9	> 43
 	60-69	< 15.9	16-22.9	23-35.9	36-40.9	> 41
Women	< 29	23.9	24-30.9	31-38.9	39-48.9	> 50
 	30-39	< 19.9	20-27.9	28-36.9	37-44.9	> 45
 	40-49	< 16.9	17-24.9	25-34.9	35-41.9	> 42
 	50-59	< 14.9	15-21.9	22-33.9	34-39.9	> 40
 	60-69	< 12.9	13-20.9	21-32.9	33-36.9	> 37
These aerobic fitness classifications are based on relative VO2 (ml/(kg*min)) and
are taken from Essentials of Exercise Physiology, 3rd ed., W. D. McArdle, F.I. Katch,
V. L. Katch, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA USA 2006, p.453

Frequently Asked Questions
How was this tool created?

This tool is based on thousands of real data points collected by Dr. Fritz Hagerman of Ohio University. Over the years, Dr. Hagerman performed VO2max tests using gas analysis on many subjects. He also had the same subjects row a max 2000m test piece on the indoor rower. He then correlated the two tests to create the formulae used in this prediction tool.

What should I make of the number I get?
What factors affect VO2max?
What are some other examples of training level?

If you have been rowing regularly for several years, training at least four days per week, doing a variety of workout types and improving your rowing scores, then we suggest selecting "Highly trained" when using the calculator.
If you consider yourself a fitness rower and don't push yourself very hard or do any hard pieces, then we suggest selecting "Not highly trained."

What is the formula used?
How much can I improve my VO2max?
What damper setting should I use for my 2000m test piece?
How should I adjust the VO2 max calculator for altitude?
Why are older age groups not included?

V02 = (Y * 1000) / Weight

Y is determined as follows:

 	Female	Male
Weight <= 61.36kg	Weight > 61.36kg	Weight <= 75kg	Weight > 75kg
Training Level: HIGH	Y = 14.6 - (1.5 * Time)	Y = 14.9 - (1.5 * Time)	Y = 15.1 - (1.5 * Time)	Y = 15.7 - (1.5 * Time)
Training Level: LOW	Y = 10.26 - (0.93 * Time)	Y = 10.7 - (0.9 * Time)
 	Time is the pace converted to minutes.
