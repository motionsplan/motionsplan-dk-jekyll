The Cooper 2.4 km (1.5 mile) run test is a simple running test of aerobic fitness, requiring only a stopwatch and running track. This is an alternative to the Cooper 12 min run test. There is another 1.5 mile run test which forms part of the Navy Physical Readiness Test (PRT).

purpose: This test measures aerobic fitness.

equipment required: 2.4 km flat and hard running course, stopwatch, recording sheets.

pre-test: Explain the test procedures to the subject. Perform screening of health risks and obtain informed consent. Prepare forms and record basic information such as age, height, body weight, gender and test conditions. Measure and mark out the course using cones. See more details of pre-test procedures.

procedure: The aim of this test is to complete the 2.4 km course in the shortest possible time. At the start, all participants line up behind the starting line. On the command ‘go,’ the clock is started and they begin running at their own pace. Although walking is allowed, it is strongly discouraged. A cool down walk should be performed at the completion of the test.

scoring: The total time to complete the course is recorded.

norms: here are some classifications of cardiovascular fitness for the cooper 1.5 mile run test for males and females aged 20-29 years. original source unknown.

| Rating    | Males       | Females     |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Very poor	| > 16:01	    | > 19:01     |
| Poor	    | 16:00-14:01	| 19:00-18:31 |
| Fair	    | 14:00-12:01	| 18:30-15:55 |
| Good	    | 12:00-10:46	| 15:54-13:31 |
| Excellent	| 10:45-9:45	| 13:30-12:30 |
| Superior	| < 9:44	    | < 12:29     |

## Udregning

Here is an equation to predict VO2max from the 1.5 mile run time, where the VO2max units is ml.kg.min-1, and time in minutes.

VO<sub>2</sub>max = (483 / time) + 3.5
