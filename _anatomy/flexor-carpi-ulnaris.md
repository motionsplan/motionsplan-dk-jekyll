function:
  da:
    - short: Flexes the wrist.
      extended: This means that the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle bends the wrist joint
        such that the angle between the palm of the hand and the front of the
        forearm decreases (i.e. it moves the palm of the hand toward the front
        of the forearm).
    - short: Adducts the hand.
      extended: This means that the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle bends the wrist
        sideways such that the little finger side of the hand moves toward the
        forearm.

origin:
  da: The flexor carpi ulnaris has two heads; a humeral head and ulnar head. The
    humeral head originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus via the
    common flexor tendon. The ulnar head originates from the medial margin of
    the olecranon of the ulnar and the upper two-thirds of the dorsal border of
    the ulnar by an aponeurosis. Between the two heads passes the ulnar nerve
    and ulnar artery.

insertion:
  da: The flexor carpi ulnaris inserts onto the pisiform, hook of the hamate (via
    the pisohamate ligament) and the anterior surface of the base of the fifth
    metacarpal (via the pisometacarpal ligament).
