rpe: 5-6
howto:
  - HR 120-150bpm
  - 30-90 min per session
exercises: "Any low intensity, low blood pressure exercise: jogging, biking, swimming, jumping rope, etc. etc., will work fine as long as heart rate is in the correct range."
frequency: 1-4 x / week
progress:
  - Speed/power at different heart rates
effect: "Improves oxygen supply by increasing how effectively the heart can deliver oxygen and develops the peripheral vascular network."

The key to the cardiac output method is to keep the heart rate between 130-150bpm. You
should be able to maintain a conversation at this pace. When you perform this method in a
seated position, your heart rate is about 10bpm lower than if you were standing. This shifts
the heart rate range to 120-140bpm.
This is a range that should be sustainable for long periods of time yet challenging enough
to stimulate improvements in aerobic fitness. Specifically, the goal of the cardiac output
method is to increase the size of the left ventricle. This method will also help develop the
vascular system and improve the endurance of slow-twitch muscle fibers.
You typically need to do the cardiac output method for at least 30 minutes in order to
stimulate adaptation.
This method is a good opportunity for practicing dynamic energy control.
You can do the cardiac output method with a variety of low-intensity, low-resistance
exercises within the same session.
