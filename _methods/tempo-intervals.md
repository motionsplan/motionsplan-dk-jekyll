tags:
  - conditioning
rpe: 5-6
howto:
  - 70% of max intensity
  - 10-12s work; 60s active rest
  - Repeat 10-20 reps
  - Use Dynamic EC during rest periods to bring HR down between bouts
exercises: "Any low-to-moderate intensity exercise such as jogging, biking, swimming, jumping rope, etc. will work as long as the overall intensity does not go above 70%."
frequency: 1-3 x / week
progress:
  - Heart rate recovery between reps
effect: "Increases work capacity while promoting regeneration between high-intensity training days by improving blood flow to moderate threshold fibers."

Tempo intervals were popularized by the late Charlie Francis, who used this method with
his sprinters to improve their speed on low-intensity training days. These intervals improve
the body’s ability to recover from high-intensity exercises, increase work capacity, and
promote regeneration without accumulating fatigue.
The key to this method is to select an intensity that’s about 70% of the athlete’s maximum
intensity. The work period is 10 seconds with a 60 second active rest period between
intervals.
Working at 70% of the maximum intensity sends extra blood flow to medium-threshold
muscle fibers, which stimulates their recovery. Avoid using higher intensities to minimize
fatigue.
If you’re doing this method indoors, start out on a machine that measures distance covered
over time. This allows you to take an initial measure of distance covered at maximum
intensity for 10 seconds. From this measure, you can determine your 70% maximum
intensity for the tempo interval work period.
Use dynamic energy control between work periods to bring the heart rate back down as
quickly as possible.
