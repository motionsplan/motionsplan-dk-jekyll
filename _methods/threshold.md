title: "Threshold Method"
tags:
  - conditioning
rpe: 8-9
howto:
  - Maintain HR ± 5 bpm of ANT
  - 5-10 min work periods x 2-5 reps
  - Maintain power output each rep
  - Complete 2-5 reps per workout
exercises: "Any cardiovascular exercise where threshold has been determined"
frequency: 1-2 x week x 3-4 weeks
progress:
  - Distance covered each rep / speed / power at threshold
effect: "Increases the aerobic system’s maximum rate of ATP regeneration so more power can be produced aerobically."

The purpose of this method is to train at or around the anaerobic threshold in order to:
1. Improve the amount of power generated at threshold
2. Increase the ability to maintain good posture, range of motion, and technique under
fatigue
Choose an exercise that allows you to measure power output or distance covered over
time. As athletes increase their endurance, they will be able to generate greater power over
a given time interval.
The anaerobic threshold changes depending on the position the athlete is in. The easiest
way for most athletes to determine their anaerobic threshold is to cover as much distance
as possible at a steady pace 12 minutes. The average heart rate over that 12 minutes will
provide an estimate of the anaerobic threshold.
General guidelines for the threshold method are:
• Maintain a heart rate between threshold level and 5bpm above threshold level for
5-10 minutes
• Produce as much power as possible within the anaerobic threshold range
• Maintain the same pace throughout the work period
• Use a moderate resistance to get the HR up to the right range
Athletes should watch their heart rate and power output during this method so that they
can learn to control both.
Following the work period, coach the athlete on how to recover efficiently by manipulating
breathing, posture, facial expressions, etc.
Record the distance covered and 60-second HR recovery to gauge improvement over time.
