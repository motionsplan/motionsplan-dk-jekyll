tags:
  - conditioning
effect: "Improves fast twitch aerobic abilities and repetitive power output by developing the rate of lactate oxidation of the slow twitch fibers."
rpe: 7-8
time: 8-10 sec work and 60 sec rest per set
intensity: High
reps: 1-3 exercises; 6-10 sets/exercise
howto:
  - Begin with 8-10 sec work and 60 sec rest per set while focusing on dynamic energy control
  - Cover as much distance as possible with each explosive burst—mark this distance
  - Use a total of 1-3 exercises; 6-10 sets/exercise
  - Actively rest 6-8 min between exercises
exercises: "Upper body: explosive push-ups, bench press, or medicine ball throws. Lower body: variations of squat jumps and split squat jumps with a kettlebell, bar, or dumbbells. Exercises with rapid, elastic rebound (SSC) component are the most effective"

The goal of the explosive repeat method is to develop the explosive endurance of the fast-
twitch fibers. Like many other training methods, explosive repeats provide an opportunity

to train recovery using dynamic energy control.

Choose an explosive exercise that makes it easy to measure power output or distance
covered. The featured exercise is called “double-leg bounds,' and it’s especially beneficial
for sports with an explosive lower body component.

Guidelines for doing explosive repeats are:

- Use work periods of 8-10 seconds (around 10-12 bounds, if doing double-leg
bounds)
- Cover as much distance as possible with each explosive burst—mark this distance
- Actively recover for 60 seconds while focusing on dynamic energy control
- Repeat the explosive work period until the athlete can no longer cover the same
distance each time

Clearly establish the target number of repetitions for each athlete and emphasize their
improvement from week-to-week.

As athletes’ fitness improve, they should work up to 10-20 sets of explosive repeats. As you
get closer to the competitive season, increase the work periods and decrease rest periods.
