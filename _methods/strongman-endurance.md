howto:
  - 60-90s work, 2-3 min active rest
  - Use challenging load
  - Repeat 2-4 sets x 1-2 exercises
exercises: "Overhead movements, safety squat bar walks, carries and implement training"

Strongman training is an effective way to improve core muscular endurance, postural
endurance, and grip strength.

General guidelines for using Strongman training with your athletes are:

• Use a work period of 60-90 seconds
• Choose a load that challenging yet manageable for the entire work period
• End the work period if the athlete is unable to maintain proper posture

There are 3 categories of Strongman endurance exercises:

1. Overhead movements—develop postural endurance and core strength
2. Safety squat bar walk—develops postural endurance and core strength
3. Carrying—develops grip strength, core strength, and postural endurance

Plate drills are relatively simple and can be done with low loads, making them a good
starting point for Strongman endurance training:

• Hold the plate and extend/lock the arms overhead
• Ensure that wrists, elbows, and shoulders are aligned, the spine is neutral, and hips
are aligned with the feet
• Maintain this posture for 30-60 seconds.
• Walk backward, forward, and sideways at a moderate pace while maintaining the
plate hold with proper posture

As plate drills become easier for your athletes, you can make them more complex by
introducing barriers such as hurdles.

Once athletes can easily perform plate drills, they can progress to safety squat bar walks.
These walks require movement patterns that are similar to plate drills but they can be
loaded much more heavily.

An excellent example of how safety squat bar walks can train endurance through fatigue is
the NSW Mile video with Jonathan Pope and Craig Weller on 8WeeksOut.com.
Carries are particularly effective for developing grip strength in addition to core strength
and postural endurance. They add an additional layer of complexity by changing the position of the loading, Try using uneven loads in each hand to train unilateral strength
development.

With carries, begin by performing similar walking movements to the safety squat bar walk
or plate drills. You can then incorporate lunges or multi-directional movements, so long as
the athletes maintain proper posture.
