The focus of the dynamic warm-up is to teach athletes how to control their energy
expenditure through dynamic energy control.
The jump rope is one of the best exercises for developing dynamic energy control because
it requires coordination, it allows athletes to change pace quickly, and it can be done while
simultaneously watching a heart rate monitor.
The athlete starts by jumping rope and raising his/her heart rate up to around 140bpm.
Next, the athlete should focus on maintaining a heart rate of 140-150bpm.
After the athlete demonstrates the ability to maintain a heart rate range, increase the
target heart rate to 160-165bpm. This narrower range at a higher heart rate is much more
difficult to sustain.
Keeping the heart rate in a narrow range requires the athlete to manage posture,
breathing rate, pace, and energy output, all of which translate to better control over
performance and fatigue prevention.
Decrease the target heart rate from 160-165bpm to 150-155bpm. The goal is for the athlete
to lower his/her heart rate as quickly as smoothly as possible. The athlete can focus on
slowing the pace and breathing while relaxing the face.
Coach the 3 cues for reducing sympathetic input and controlling energy expenditure:
• Posture
• Pace
• Face
Next, tell the athlete to reduce his/her heart rate to 140bpm while focusing on the 3 cues.
Once he/she has reached 140bpm, increase the target heart rate to 170bpm.
You can use a variety of heart rate ranges in different orders, but the key is to teach the
athlete to consciously control energy expenditure at different intensities.
Narrow the heart rate ranges as the athlete’s experience with dynamic energy control
increases.
