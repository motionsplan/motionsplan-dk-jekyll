**På Vejle Idrætshøjskole er vi ved at beskrive forskellige metoder til træning. Denne side er under udarbejdelse. Hvis du vil hjælpe med beskrivelsen, så er det meget værdsat.**

I et dropsæt starter du løftet med en given vægt. Når du har nået RPE 9-10 i øvelsen, så dropper du med det samme noget af vægten og fortsætter med flere gentagelser.

Fx kan du lave et 6 - 8 - 10 dropset.

- Først laver du to almindelige sæt med 2x6 sæt med RPE 9.
- I tredje sæt gør du klar til dropsættet.
- Start med en vægt, du kan løfte 6 gange.
- Drop vægten øjeblikkeligt med 25-40% og lav 8 reps med den nye vægt.
- Drop igen vægten med 25-40% og lav 10 reps mere.

Ex Triceps extension, dumbbell hammer curl, incline bench press or incline dumbbell press
Usage: 2 sets of 6 and one 6-8-10 dropset

Drop sets are probably the most well-researched advanced technique. The method involves doing multiple sets to failure immediately after one another, without taking any rest between sets.

This is accomplished by reducing the weight on the bar for each set.
Research investigating the long-term effects of training with drop sets has been done, but is conflicting. Some studies indicate that the additional drop sets provide no additional benefits beyond the first set. However, other studies indicate that drop sets involving a total of three sets produce just as much hypertrophy as three conventional sets to failure.

On balance, it seems that a drop set workout comprising a total of three sets to failure (with two drops in weight from the first set) produces essentially the same amount of hypertrophy as three sets to failure with the same weight, with moderate (90-second to 3-minute) rests between sets. The studies in the literature have taken a varied approach to the rest period duration used by the comparison group, which is a bit problematic given that rest period duration does affect muscle growth, but even so.

Since drop sets are normally performed with moderate loads, each set should involve a similar number of stimulating reps, regardless of the weight on the bar. Therefore, we should perhaps not be too surprised that a drop set with three total sets produces similar muscle growth to three conventional sets to failure. However, drop sets involve performing multiple sets immediately after one another, with little rest, and we know that longer rests are superior for hypertrophy from both long-term training studies and also assessments of muscle protein synthesis rates.

Short rest periods probably reduce hypertrophy by either (1) allowing lifters to do subsequent sets before central nervous system fatigue has dissipated, or by (2) triggering greater central nervous system fatigue through either greater aerobic demand or afferent feedback. Since all of these factors are likely also produced by drop sets, it remains mysterious why they are not less effective than the same number of conventional sets to failure.

Ultimately, it seems that drop sets allow the same number of stimulating reps to be accomplished in a shorter amount of time. This may be advantageous for advanced bodybuilders who struggle to fit their target training volume into a workout.
