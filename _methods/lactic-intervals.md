rpe: 8-9
intensity: Max
time: 30-40 seconds
reps: Active rest 3-5 min, repeat 2-5 reps
howto:
  - 40-60s work at max intensity
  - Measure 60s HRR
  - Active rest 3-5 min, repeat 2-5 reps
exercises: "Any exercise that can be performed at maximal intensity, e.g. sprints or sport-specific drills"
frequency: 1-2 x / week x 3-4 weeks

  - Distance covered per rep
  - Ability to repeat distance
  - 60s HRR
effect: "Improves the lactic system’s ability to deliver energy and increase the body’s overall tolerance to anaerobic metabolism."

The keys to performing lactic intervals are:

- Use a work period of 30-40 seconds at 100% intensity
- Cover as much distance during the work period as possible while maintaining
proper technique
- Cover as close to the same distance as possible during each work period
- Actively recover 1-4 minutes, depending on the level of the athlete
- Perform 2-5 reps, depending on the level of the athlete

This is a highly fatiguing method, so it’s important to train proper technique as fatigue
develops. Use mechanical cues rather than speed cues to help athletes reinforce good
movement habits.

This is an ideal method for using dynamic energy control to drive the heart rate down
between work periods. Gauge the athlete’s 60-second heart rate recovery to measure
his/her effectiveness at controlling energy output.

Keep in mind that the rest interval is just as important as the work interval. The rest
interval, when done effectively, adequately prepares athletes to perform the next work
interval.

You can help athletes develop core stability under fatigue by transitioning them to a plank
immediately following their lactic intervals.
