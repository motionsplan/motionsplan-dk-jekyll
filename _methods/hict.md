title: "High Intensity Continuous Training (HICT)"
tags:
  - conditioning
rpe: 7-8
intensity: Max
time: 5-20 min
reps: Low speed
howto:
  - Use maximum resistance
  - Low speed (20-30rpm on a spin bike)
  - 5-20 min total time
  - Keep HR below anaerobic threshold
exercises: "Spin bike, Versaclimber, lunges up a steep hill, bike ride up a steep hill, box step-ups, etc."
frequency: 1-2 x / week x 6-8 weeks
progress:
  - Speed at given HR
  - Time exercise can be maintained
effect: "Creates a high level of stimulus to increase oxygen utilization and improve endurance of the moderate threshold fast-twitch muscle fibers."

Both the cadence and resistance of this method engage the fast-twitch muscle fibers over
longs periods of time.

Increase the exercise resistance to the point where the athlete slows down while still
activating the fast-twitch fibers. The Keiser bike or VersaClimber work very well for this
purpose.

The guidelines for High Intensity Continuous Training (HICT) on the Keiser bike are:

• Set the resistance level to about 20
• Maintain a speed of 25-30rpm
• Perform 10-20 minutes of total work
• Keep heart rate below the anaerobic threshold

As the athlete fatigues, focus on coaching proper technique while maintaining a constant
power output.

The HICT method facilitates recovery in addition to developing fast-twitch fiber endurance.
The concentric-only nature of the HICT movements incurs less tissue stress than eccentric
movements. This method also increases blood flow to fast-twitch fibers which often
accumulate the most training fatigue; the result is a decrease in recovery time.
When using HICT for active recovery, adjust the total work time to 5-10 minutes.
