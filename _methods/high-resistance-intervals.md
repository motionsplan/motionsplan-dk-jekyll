title: "High Resistance Intervals"
tags:
  - conditioning
rpe: 6-7
howto:
  - Each rep is at maximal intensity
  - 5s work followed by rest until HR is 130-140bpm
  - 10-20 min total time/session
exercises: "Uphill sprints, sled drags, spin bikes, treadmill (set around 15% incline) or other cardio machines capable of high resistance"
frequency: 1-2 x / week - 6-8 weeks
progress:
  - Distance covered in each rep
  - Number of reps
  - Heart rate recovery
effect: "Improves the aerobic abilities of the fast-twitch muscle fibers so that high power can be maintained longer."

This interval method uses high resistance to improve the endurance and recovery of fast-
twitch muscle fibers. One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is through inclined

running.
General guidelines for High Resistance Intervals (HRI) are:
• Set around a 15% incline
• Cover as much distance as possible over a 5 second work period while maintaining
proper technique
• Actively recover until HR returns to 130-140bpm, depending on the athlete’s fitness
level
• If the HR does not go above 130-140bpm in the first few reps, actively recover for 60
seconds between work periods
• Set the total time to 10-20 minutes, depending on the athlete’s fitness level
• Count the number of reps completed over the total time
Focus on HR recovery using dynamic energy control in between work periods.
Gauge improvements in fast-twitch muscle fiber endurance by monitoring the number of
work periods the athlete can complete it a given time frame. If this number increases, the
athlete has increased his/her fast-twitch fiber endurance—make sure to point out this
improvement!
