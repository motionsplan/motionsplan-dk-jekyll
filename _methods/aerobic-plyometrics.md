Aerobic plyometrics are a great way to decrease the risk of soft tissue injuries in sports that
have lots of running.
Sharp transitions between the off-season, the pre-season, and the competitive season
often correspond to soft-tissue injuries. This is because lower body training stress is not
increased gradually enough during these preparatory phases.
Aerobic plyometrics help improve the elasticity and durability of lower body tissues, which
increases their ability to handle stress over time.
General guidelines for the aerobic plyometric method featured in this video are:
• Use a low-moderate hurdle height
• Aim for 8-15 sub-maximal jumps in between hurdles
• Rest 10-30 seconds before repeating the hurdle jumps
• Perform a short work period of 3-5 minutes and gradually increase to 10-12 minutes
Look for proper jumping technique and minimal ground contact time between jumps.
Movements should appear fluid and elastic and the athlete’s upper and lower body should
remain coordinated. There should be enough rest between sets to avoid fatigue.
As athletes develop greater elasticity over time, you can increase the number of hurdles
and the hurdle height. You can also vary the distances between hurdles and the complexity
of the jumps.
Use this method more frequently as your athletes get closer to their competitive season.
