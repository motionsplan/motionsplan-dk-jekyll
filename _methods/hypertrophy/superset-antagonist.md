Antagonist supersets involve performing alternating sets of two exercises for opposing muscle groups. For example, the bench press is often supersetted with a row variation.

By targeting completely different muscle groups, each exercise can be trained with a fairly long rest period, while alternating exercises are performed with much shorter rest periods. Sometimes, the exercises are done immediately after one another, followed by a moderately long rest. At other times, the exercises are equally spaced with short rest periods between them. Either approach allows workouts of a given volume to be accomplished much more quickly, or larger volume workouts to be done in the same period of time.

To date, no long-term studies have compared the effects of training with a normal sequence of exercises and with antagonist supersets.

However, research has shown that supersetting the chest press and seated row exercises allows a greater number of reps to be performed in each exercise in the later sets. These extra reps are likely the result of the fatigued antagonist muscle producing less force during the subsequent agonist exercise, and this is unlikely to be particularly helpful for hypertrophy. Yet, it does suggest that there is no negative effect of supersets on training volume, which might be expected if there was increased central nervous system fatigue secondary to either a greater aerobic demand or afferent feedback, as with using short rest periods between sets of the same exercise.

Therefore, it seems likely that antagonist supersets allow the same number of stimulating reps to be accomplished in a shorter amount of time, and this may well be advantageous for advanced bodybuilders who struggle to fit their target training volume into a workout.
