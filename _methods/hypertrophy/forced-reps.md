Forced repetitions involve a spotter providing assistance to the lifter to perform additional reps after reaching muscular failure.

Although they look very different, forced repetitions are essentially identical to drop sets, except it is the spotter that reduces the effective external resistance of the barbell weight by providing an upward force, instead of the external resistance being reduced by taking weight from the bar.

Currently, there is very limited research into the effects of forced repetitions, and such research has only assessed changes in maximum strength and not muscle size. Even so, based on the essentially identical nature of forced repetitions and drop sets, it seems likely that they will have similar effects, with the main downside being the inability to quantify the magnitude of the force being exerted during the forced repetitions, which makes tracking progressive overload practically impossible.
