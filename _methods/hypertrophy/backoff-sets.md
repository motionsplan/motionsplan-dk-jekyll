Back off sets involve performing additional sets with a lighter weight immediately (or shortly) after a main sequence of heavier sets. Since heavy loads are used in the main part of the workout, this technique is more often used by strength athletes, than by bodybuilders.
Even so, the long-term research that has been performed into back off sets suggests that they are effective for increasing hypertrophy, most likely because they increase the total number of stimulating reps in the workout.

Such beneficial effects are likely only going to be apparent when the main sets are performed with heavy loads (and therefore involve little aerobic demand, minimal afferent feedback associated with metabolite accumulation, and few stimulating reps per set), such that the addition of a set with a light or moderate load to failure causes a large increase in the number of stimulating reps for the workout. Adding a back off set with a light load on the end of a workout involving multiple sets to failure with a moderate load may not have the same incrementally beneficial effect.
