Rest-pause er en ret udbredt teknik. Pointen er, at du i løbet af dine sæt laver to ultrakorte pauser på 10-15 sekunder, så du samlet set kan lave en større volumen i det sidste sæt end du ellers ville have kunnet gøre. Typisk vil et rest-pause sæt ende på en RPE på 10.

Du kan fx lave rest-pause i pullups.

- Lav x8 reps - hvil i 10-15 sekunder
- Lav x4-6 reps mere - hvil i 10-15 sekunder
- Lav x2-6 reps mere
- Det betyder, at du måske kan få 4-6 gentagelser end du ellers ville have kunnet få i et almindeligt sæt.

Rest pause training involves performing one main set, followed by additional sets with very short (20-second) rests. Since the weight on the bar is not altered, these additional sets tend to involve only a small number of reps compared to the first set. Moreover, rest pause training often targets a total number of reps for the workout, with the number of additional sets being varied to reach this target.

Rest pause training has shown promising results in the research that has been performed to date. Even so, this research is limited insofar as the comparison group probably did not do each of their multiple sets to failure. Even so, it is likely that rest pause training simply allows lifters to perform additional stimulating reps, with the added benefit that each rep in the later sets is a stimulating rep, which makes the approach quite efficient.

While rest pause training has attracted adherents because of its efficiency, it does have a downside compared to conventional sets to failure or drop sets. Unless carefully calibrated, each additional set after the first main set will involve fewer than five reps, which means that quite a few additional sets are required to reach a meaningful number of stimulating reps for the workout. This requires training to failure many times, and this may delay recovery.

Ultimately, rest pause training likely allows the same number of stimulating reps to be achieved in a shorter amount of time, due to the very short rest periods between additional sets that can be used without negative effects. This may be advantageous for advanced bodybuilders who struggle to fit their target training volume into a workout.
