This method is spectacularly effective when it comes to bringing up weak points, especially if you have a bad mind-muscle connection with that muscle. Having a bad mind-muscle connection is one of the main reasons for a lagging muscle group. This method is very simple and effective, but painful.

Start each exercise with an isometric hold in the position where the lagging muscle is the most heavily involved. You hold that position for 30 seconds. As soon as the 30 seconds are over, without any rest, you perform 8-10 regular reps.

The iso hold will light up the target muscle and it will be easy to feel it doing the work during the regular reps. This will solve your mind-muscle connection problem in no time and allow you to quickly correct a lagging muscle group.

During the 30-second hold, make a voluntary effort to contract and squeeze the target muscle, not just hold the position. Depending on the exercise, the hold will be at various positions, as laid out below:

- Compound Exercises: Hold for 30 seconds, then do 8-10 full reps.
- Bench Press: Hold at 90 degree elbow position
- Incline Bench Press: Hold 2-3 inches above the 90-degree angle
- Overhead Press: Hold at eyes or forehead level
- Squat (if glutes are weak): Hold at parallel
- Squat (if quads are weak): Hold at 90-100 degree knee angle
- Chin-Up or Pulldown: Hold at contracted position, bar at chest level
- Isolation Exercises: Hold for 30 seconds, then do 8-10 full reps.
- PecDeck or Cable Cross-Over: Hold at contracted position, pads or handles close together
- Biceps Curl: Hold at mid-range
- Triceps Pushdown: Hold at contracted position, arms extended
- Leg Extension: Hold at contracted position, legs extended
- Leg Curl: Hold at mid-range
- Lateral or Front Raise: Hold just short of contracted position, right below shoulders to avoid engaging traps
- Cable or Swiss Ball Crunch: Hold at contracted position
