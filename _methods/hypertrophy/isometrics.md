And now for something completely different! Isometric training is an extremely powerful training method that you can use to spur on additional muscle growth.

However, if you are like most trainees I am willing to bet that you have never intentionally used isometric methods in your own program design.

I promise you that if you use any of the following techniques in your own training that you will make some of the best gains in your life.

Isometric Training Method #1: Isometronics

Let’s kick things off with a bench press isometronics routine.

Isometronics can be thought of as a combination of partial range of motion repetitions and full-bore overcoming isometric contractions.

You are going to need a power rack and two sets of safety pins in order to perform this method. Let’s take a look at the exact routine and some training videos before discussing it further. Check it out:

Bench Press Isometronics Hypertrophy Routine

A1: Bench press bottom-position isometronics (medium grip), 3 x 6**, 1/0/X/0, 120 seconds rest
B1: Bench press mid-position isometronics (medium grip), 3 x 6**, 1/0/X/0, 120 seconds rest
C1: Bench press mid-position isometronics (medium grip), 3 x 6**, 1/0/X/0, 120 seconds rest
D1: Bench press (medium grip), 1 x 6, 3/0/X/0, 120 seconds rest
E1: Decline ez-bar extension w/ chains (close grip, to chin), 3 x 6-8, 2/0/X/0, 90 seconds rest


**Perform 6 partial reps in between the safety pins (see video). On your fifth rep perform an overcoming isometric contraction into the top pin for 6-8 total seconds. You are trying to break the pins in half on this isometric!

**After the 6-8 second isometric contraction you lower the weight down to the bottom pins and attempt a seventh repetition. If you are able to complete this 7th rep then you need to increase the weight on the next set. If you fail on the 7th rep then the weight was just right.

Here is the training video for this isometronics workout:



The idea behind this routine is to pre-fatigue your muscles with several partial ranges of motion repetitions before performing one all-out overcoming isometric contraction for 6-8 seconds.

This combination is particularly nasty and will cause a tremendous amount of muscular damage to the fast-twitch muscle fibers.

The overcoming isometric contraction is very beneficial for hypertrophy purposes as you will be able to recruit a lot of otherwise dormant muscle fibers.

If you are going to perform this routine then you may want to perform it only every other chest workout.

For example, you could perform a simple 5 x 5 bench press routine in between every isometronics workout. This will help to prevent you from overtraining.

Isometric Training Method #2: Iso-Dynamics

An iso-dynamic set involves supersetting an isometric contraction with more traditional lifting. I learned this exact routine from Josh Bryant.

I can attest to its effectiveness as I have had some of my online coaching clients run it with outstanding results. Check it out:



Josh Bryant Triceps Iso-Dynamics Routine

A1: Close grip bench press overcoming isometric (3 inches shy of lockout)***, 3 x 6 seconds, 10 seconds rest
A2: Close grip bench press w/ bands, 3 x 3, 2/0/X/0, 10 seconds rest
A3: Decline DB extension, 3 x 10, 5/0/1/0, 300 seconds rest
The overcoming isometric contraction in exercise “A1” will prime your nervous system and allow you to lift more weight in the second and third exercises. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic hypertrophy routine for the triceps.


Here is Josh Bryant taking two of his personal training clients through this exact workout:



I highly recommend you watch this video in its entirety if you are interested in using iso-dynamic training in your own training routines.

Josh Bryant could easily be regarded as one of the world’s leading experts on isometric training for bodybuilders and powerlifters. When Josh talks isometric training you would be wise to listen.

Isometric Training Method #3: Yielding Isometrics

Yielding isometrics are another way to utilize isometric training. Unlike the other two isometric training methods covered so far yielding isometrics involve preventing a weight from lowering down to the ground.

For example, if you hold your arms straight out to your sides then you are performing a yielding isometric contraction for your shoulders.

Yielding isometrics can be thought of as another form of eccentric training and are fantastic for stimulating hypertrophy gains.

One of the best ways to take advantage of yielding isometrics is to perform them at three separate points in a movement at the end of a set. Check it out:



Yielding Isometrics Upper Back Routine

A1: Shoulder-width supinated chin ups, 5 x 5-7***, 4/0/X/0, 180 seconds rest
A2: Seated cable rope face pull, 3 x 10-12, 2/0/1/2, 120 seconds rest 
***Perform 3 seperate 8-second isometric pauses on the eccentric portion of your final repetition. You should perform these pauses near the top, at mid-range, and near the bottom of the exercise.

In my experience the upper back and biceps respond extremely well to yielding isometric protocols. If you give this upper back routine an honest try I am sure you will be pleased with the results!
