title: "Cardiac Power Intervals"
tags:
  - conditioning
rpe: 9-10
howto:
  - Maintain max HR for 20-30s/rep
  - Immediately follow with 60s plank
  - Bring HR to 120-130bpm w/ Dynamic EC
  - Repeat 2-4 reps
exercises: "Any cardiovascular exercise that uses the whole body and drives HR to maximum – low impact exercises preferred. Use any high intensity exercise that maximally elevates the heart rate, such as sprinting or other total body exercises or drills"
frequency: 1 x / week x 2-3 weeks
progress:
  - Speed / power at max HR
  - HRR in 1 minute
  - Number of reps
effect: "Help improve oxygen supply at higher intensities and improve the power endurance of cardiac muscle."

Cardiac power intervals use the highest intensity possible to drive the heart rate up to the
maximum level. The goal of this method is to develop the contractility of the heart at the
highest heart rates. Cardiac power intervals allow you to coach technique and skill under
fatigue since this is an extremely tiring method.
As athletes’ heart rates rise, reinforce proper mechanics by cuing any lapsing areas of their
technique.
General guidelines for cardiac power intervals are:
• Increase the heart rate to maximum while maintaining proper technique
• Maintain the maximum heart rate for 20-30 seconds
• Immediately transition to a front plank or sport-specific movement for 60 seconds
• Bring the heart rate down to 120-130 bpm as quickly as possible using dynamic
energy control
• Repeat this process for a total of 2-4 sets
You can use sport-specific exercises or sprints, or lower-impact methods such as the
VerasClimber to perform this method.
Use the time after the work period to train sport-specific skill/movement or to develop core
endurance under fatigue.
This method is best used at the end of the pre-season to build off of the fitness foundation
developed in the off-season and early pre-season. It should not be used with beginners.
You can gauge changes in fitness with this method by comparing the distance the athlete
covers from one rep to the next and seeing how this changes each week. As athletes
improve, the disparity in distance covered from one rep to the next should decrease.
